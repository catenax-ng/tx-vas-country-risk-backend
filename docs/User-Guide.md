## Country Rating Component

![Rating](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-6-26.png)

This Component includes multiple smaller Functionalities  

- Year Selection
- Gate Selection
- Show More Ratings
- Upload Rating
- Download Template
- Weighting of Ratings
- Deletion of Ratings

The first step you need to take is to select a year.

![Year](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-11-8.png)

After you selected a year the Rating List will be updated. The Ratings in the List are saved for the selected year.  
Currently all Globally available Ratings are Open Source. We do not create Scores, we only collect them and aggregate them according to your selections.  

![RatingTable](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-12-24.png)

Next to the Year Selection you will find the the Gate selection. This selection will be done for you atuomatically on the first start-up of the Dashbaord.  

![Gateselect](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-13-58.png)

The Gate gives the Input on which Business Partners you will be able see in all components.  
Thereafter you can select one or multiple Ratings in the Table.  

![Ratingselected](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-19-57.png)

If you want to select more Ratings at once you can Opena Pop-Up with the 'Show Ratings' Button  
In this Table you can manipulate the same way oyu can in the smaller Table.  

![Popupselection](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-37-20.png)


After selecting a Rating the World Map will change the Color of each individual Country.  
How is this done. Each Rating has a score for most of the Countries. We have a Score Range of 0-100 for each Rating  
For Example the CPI Rating has a Score of 45 for China and 29 for Russia.  
Depending on your selection with the Ranges the Country is then colored.  

![WorldMap](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-32-21.png)

As you can see the Weighting column to the right of the Names are automatically created and evenly distributed.  
This weighting can be customized individually.  

The Rules for the weighting are:
   1. always needs to add up to 100%
   ![weighting](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-24-0.png)
   2. automatic weighting overwrites upon selecting new Raings
   3. when changing you need to confiem value by pressing "enter"
Changing the Weighting changes the Scores given in the Table below. How the Scores are calculated is this desbrided there.


### How can i Upload my own Rating and what do i need to know.

The First step is to Download the Template. This is important since this is the Only Format the Application can progress the Upload.

![excelfile](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-43-52.png)
![excellist](../docs/User-Guide-Images/image2023-1-16_11-44-50.png)

After selecting the Target group you can select the year for which this Rating is relevant for.  
Below the year selection you can Give a Name to the Rating. A Rating Name can only be given once.  
This Name is then shown in the Rating table after finishing the Upload.

If the User selects a Rating we create a Score depending on his selection in the Rating Table and Color the background according to the Ranges set.  

The Score in the Column "Score" is calculated as follows.  

Situation 1:  
You choose 1 Rating. The Score is taken from the database and shown. If there is none the field will be left empty. The Colore is chosen depending on the Ranges  

Situation 2:  
You choose more than 1 Rating. The Formula: (Rating1 * Weighting1) + (Rating2 + Weighting2) + ... as many Ratings as you chose.  

Situation 3:  
You choose more than 1 rating but there is only one Score.  
Then the Formula looks like this: (Rating1(available) * Weighting1(100%)) + (Rating2(n/A) + Weighting2(0%)) + ...
